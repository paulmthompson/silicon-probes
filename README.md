# silicon-probes

This repository includes some documentation necessary for using silicon probes. Specifically, I have included a list of probes that I have used, and a probe interface (https://github.com/SpikeInterface/probeinterface) notebook that generates the channel mapping for these probes with A32 to Intan RHD2132 headstages. I have also created xml files that can be used in the Intan RHX software so that the channel map can be visualized while recording.  
  
Current probes are:  
- A1x32-Poly2-A32 (Neuronexus)
- Buzsaki32L-A32 (Neuronexus)
